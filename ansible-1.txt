Idempotence
-----------
if you run a program multiple time,that can create samething multiple
times even you run your program infinite times,it should not create any
damage.

pull based configure
---------------------
chef server

we will configure agents to check every one hour

24*7=168 times it will connect to server
bandwidth waste 
resource consumption like CPU and Memory.

PULL
------
1.nodes should connect to the servers through the software.
2.nodes should downloaad the configuration periodically.say every 30 min.
3.even there is no change in configuration,agents connect to the servers that creates unnecessary traffic and data.
  consumption.
PUSH
-------
1.unlike pull there is no need of agent installation.
2.whenever there is a change in configuration,server can push to the node directly.
3.ansible uses ssh authentication to connect to the servers.

how to install ansible?
sudo yum install ansible -y

how to connect to node server using the main server?
ansible all -i "54.163.222.183," -u centos --extra-vars "ansible_password=DevOps321" -m ping

linux-->everything is called as command but in ansible everything is called as module.

ansible is from RedHat and centos creators

playbook--is a file of modules or collections
playbook has YAML syntax-->yet markup language.

ansible inventory is the list of host that the ansible server will connecct to.

ansible-playbook -i inventory -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 01-playbook.yaml
